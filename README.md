# EDA on Aerofit Fitness Data

## Description  
This notebook performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and insights. The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the structure of the data and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.  


## Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks  
- Conduct statistical analysis and hypothesis testing  
- Visualize key insights using plots, histograms, and boxplots  
- Identify correlations and patterns to inform future modeling

## Methodology / Steps  
- Load and explore the dataset (shape, missing values, data types)  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
- Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis (mean, median, mode, correlations)  
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Summarize key findings and prepare the dataset for modeling  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
Python, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
