# Exploratory Data Analysis of Aerofit Treadmill Customer Data Using Python

## Problem Statement  
Aerofit, a fitness equipment manufacturer, seeks to better understand the demographic and behavioral characteristics of customers who purchase different treadmill models. The objective is to uncover patterns and correlations that can guide targeted marketing, improve product positioning, and prepare the data for future predictive modeling.

## Tools Used  
- Python: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook: for interactive coding and visualization  
- Dataset: Structured CSV file

---

## Description  
This notebook performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and insights within the Aerofit treadmill dataset. It includes data cleaning, statistical profiling, and visualization techniques to understand the dataset and prepare it for future machine learning tasks.

## Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks  
- Conduct statistical analysis and hypothesis testing  
- Visualize key insights using histograms, boxplots, and count plots  
- Identify correlations and trends to inform business decisions and modeling

---

## Methodology / Steps  

### 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration  
- Loaded the dataset and reviewed structure (shape, data types)  
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and categorical feature distributions  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Handled missing values and duplicate records  
- Detected and addressed outliers using the IQR method  

### 3. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis  
- Analyzed numerical features: Age, Income, Miles, Usage  
- Examined categorical features: Product, Gender, Marital Status  
- Applied summary statistics: mean, median, mode, value counts  

### 4. Data Visualization  
- Plotted distributions, boxplots, and count plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Visualized pairwise relationships with pairplot  
- Created a correlation heatmap to identify linear relationships  

### 5. Insight Summary & Dataset Finalization  
- Summarized key findings from EDA  
- Final dataset is clean, structured, and ready for modeling

---

## Outcome / Impact  
- Product choice is influenced by gender and marital status  
- High-income and fitness-conscious customers show higher treadmill usage  
- Visualization insights assist in customer segmentation and targeted marketing  
- Cleaned dataset ready for predictive modeling or business analysis
